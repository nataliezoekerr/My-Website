<br>
I'm a population ecologist interested in life history evolution and population dynamics of plants, insects, and organisms with complex social structures. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <span style="color:blue">[Morris lab](https://biology.duke.edu/people/william-f-morris)</span> at Duke University. My research is focused on building  spatially-explicit individual-based models to evaluate the effects of fire on meta-population dynamics of Venus flytraps, *Dionaea muscipula*. 

In 2012, I graduated from the University of Queensland with a bachelor of Environmental Science with first class honours majoring in Natural Resources Science. After graduating, I was a research assistant at the University of Queensland in the <span style="color:blue">[Buckley Lab](https://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/groups/buckley/)</span> working on various projects on ecological economics <img src="/img/portrait4.jpg" style="width:33%; border:2px solid; margin-left: 20px; margin-top:10px" align="right"> and species distribution modelling as well as helping set up a field site for <span style="color:blue">[NutNet](http://www.nutnet.umn.edu/)</span> in Brisbane, Australia. In 2013, I was also a field assistant at Harvard Forest, MA working on plant and insect demography projects, which is where I discovered my love for entomology before pursuing a PhD at Tufts. 

In 2019, I completed my PhD in the <span style="color:blue">[Crone Lab](http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/crone/)</span> at Tufts University. My PhD research involved using population models to evaluate life history strategies and trade-offs in insects. More specifically, I investigated the contribution of worker size variation in bumble bee, *Bombus vosnesenskii*, colonies and how this variation contributes toward colony growth. I also investigated the demographic consequences of shifting phenology of the mustard white butterfly in response to a warming climate. 


In my spare time, you can often find me gardening - both indoor and outdoor gardening. I love creating and designing native pollinator-friendly gardens for my family and friends. If I'm not gardening, I will be social dancing. My first love is Brazilian zouk, and my second love is fusion dancing.
