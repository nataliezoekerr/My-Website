### <u>Public Outreach</u>  

**Darwin Day at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences, Nov 2019**
I ran and organized the "How Do Scientists Study Plant Populations?" exhibit at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences Darwin Day event with Melina Keighron. Our exhibit showcased activities on how to collect data on the native venus flytrap as well as posters showing the various research on plants that occurs across the United States from Hawaii to Alaska to North Carolina from researchers in the Morris Lab at Duke University.  

**DSA Ecosocialism working group, May 2018**  
I gave a 15-minute presentation on pollinators and actions (from the individual to the international-level) to help save pollinators at the monthly meeting for the Boston Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Ecosocialism working group at Boston University.

### <u>Volunteer work</u>  

**Heron Island Research Station, Sept-Nov 2013**  
I volunteered for a PhD candidate, now <span style="color:blue">[Dr. Robert Mason](https://www.marinespatialecologylab.org/robert-mason)</span>, with his project on the physiological stress of different light levels and elevated temperature on coral. Using these data with satellite remote sensing, his project aimed to predict coral reefs susceptibility to coral bleaching.

This non-profit student organization held fundraising events to raise money for students to help with conservation work at Idalia National Park in central QLD, Australia.
