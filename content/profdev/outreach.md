### <u>Public Outreach</u>  

**DSA Ecosocialism working group, May 2018**  
I gave a 15-minute presentation on pollinators and actions (from the individual to the international-level) to help save pollinators at the monthly meeting for the Boston DSA Ecosocialism working group at Boston University.

I ran and organized the native bee booth at the Tuft's Animal Wel"Fair" with Tufts graduate students, Genevieve Pugesek and Nick Dorian. We provide an activity centered around native bee facts as well as provided information on their biology, reasons for declines, and ways to help native bees.   

**Science and Engineering Fair, March 2016**  
I was a judge of student's posters at the Science and Engineering Fair at Somerville High School.   

**Native Bee Booth at Earth Day fair, April 2014**  
I both ran and organized the native bee booth at the Earth Fair. I provided information on their biology, reasons for declines, and ways to help native bees.

### <u>Volunteer work</u>  

**Heron Island Research Station, Sept-Nov 2013**  
I volunteered for a PhD candidate, now <span style="color:blue">[Dr. Robert Mason](https://www.marinespatialecologylab.org/robert-mason)</span>, with his project on the physiological stress of different light levels and elevated temperature on coral. Using these data with satellite remote sensing, his project aimed to predict coral reefs susceptibility to coral bleaching.

**Idalia National Park, 2008-2012**  
I was a volunteer member of Idalia Recovery Organisation of Students (iROOS) at the University of Queensland for four years. This non-profit student organization held fundraising events to raise money for students to help with conservation work at Idalia National Park in central QLD, Australia.
