**Workshop EntSoc (Volunteer)**

I volunteered to help with a R workshop called "Exploiting the Dynamism of R Software to Help
Entomologists Adapt to a Changing World: Crossing the Border from R Admirer to R User" at 2018 EntSoc conference in Vancouver, BC. This workshop was run by <span style="color:blue">[Robert Zinna](https://www.mhu.edu/staff/zinna-robert/)</span> and <span style="color:blue">[Keaton Wilson](http://keatonwilson.net/)</span>. 


**Delta Method and Parametric Bootstrapping, March 2018**

I organized and ran a half-day workshop on the Delta Method (msm::deltamethod) and parametric bootstrapping (MASS::mvrnorm) for calculating variance in model predicted values in program R.  I held the workshop for the Entomology Department at UC Davis, CA.
