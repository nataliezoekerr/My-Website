      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a population ecologist interested in life history evolution and population dynamics of insects. Currently, I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Crone Lab at Tufts University. My research involves using population models to evaluate life history strategies and trade-offs in insects. More specifically, I am investigating the adaptive significance of worker size variation in bumble bee (Bombus vosnesenskii) colonies and how this variation contributes toward colony growth. I am also investigating life history trade-offs between the invasive exotic cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) and its non-invasive native counterpart, the mustard white butterfly (Pieris oleracea) as well as the effects of a warming climate on the phenology of the mustard white.</description>
